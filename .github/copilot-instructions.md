- **Target Platform**: Windows Desktop

## Key Commands

```powershell
cargo tauri dev          # Development mode with hot reload
cargo tauri build        # Build production installer
cargo check              # Check Rust code
cargo fmt                # Format Rust code
cargo clippy             # Lint Rust code
```

## Development Notes
- Tauri allows building lightweight desktop apps with web frontends
- Rust backend handles file I/O for Star Citizen keybinding files
- Frontend provides UI for mapping configuration

## Version Management
- Version is maintained in 3 places: `tauri.conf.json`, `Cargo.toml`, and `package.json`
- The HTML header dynamically loads the version from Cargo.toml at runtime
- To update version: change all 3 files to keep them in sync
- See VERSION.md for details
